## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Build Output
- **CSS**: 47.08 kB (7.14 kB gzipped)
- **JavaScript**: 474.38 kB (154.78 kB gzipped)
- **Total**: ~521 kB (~162 kB gzipped)

### Runtime Performance
- ✅ Fast initial load time
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Efficient state updates
- ✅ Minimal memory usage
- ✅ No memory leaks detected

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "ethers": "^6.15.0",
  "simple-peer": "^9.11.1"
}
```

### Development Dependencies
- Vite for build tooling
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality
- PostCSS for CSS processing

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Reactive State Management**
   ```javascript
   // Custom state manager with middleware support
   const stateManager = createStateManager(initialState, {
     persistence: true,
     logging: true,
     performance: true
   });
   ```

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   ```javascript
   // Type-safe event system
   globalEventBus.emit(EVENTS.WALLET_CONNECTED, walletState);
   globalEventBus.on(EVENTS.PAYMENT_SUCCESS, handlePaymentSuccess);
   ```

3. **Advanced Error Handling**
   ```javascript
   // Comprehensive error tracking and user feedback
   errorTracker.trackError(error, context);
   logger.error('Operation failed', { error, context });
   ```

4. **Performance Monitoring**
   ```javascript
   // Automatic performance tracking
   performanceMonitor.measure('operation', () => {
     // Measured code
   });
   ```
